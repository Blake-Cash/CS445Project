To get this inserted onto another machine, you would obviously not use the localhost, but you would simply modify any part of it that says localhost to whatever your host is, and then find some way to get your .crt accepted by their browser. For instance, you could perform a scam in order to trick someone into modifying their policies, or write a script to do so (for firefox)
